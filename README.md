# odin-recipes
This HTML project, explores basic html concepts like lists(ordered and unordered), anchors and headings. 

The indes page displays a list. This list consists of links to a recipe page. 
Each recipe page provides:
- a header of the food name
- ingredients needed
- steps to follow
-a link back to the home(index) page

For the CSS aspect:
-The index page was styled with a brown aesthetic with lighter texts
-The recipe pages now have a bubblegum green aesthetic with darker texts
